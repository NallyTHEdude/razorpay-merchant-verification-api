# Merchant Analysis API

An API that automates merchant verification and validity checks, while detecting potentially fraudulent merchants without manual intervention.

- Swagger is used for API documentation, so feel free to experiment with the available endpoints using your own data.
- The verification pipeline runs asynchronously using Inngest.

## Tech Stack Used

1. **TypeScript + Express.js** — REST API development.
2. **Zod** — Environment variable and input validation.
3. **Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL + pgvector** — Database access and vector embeddings.
4. **Swagger** — OpenAPI-based API documentation.
5. **Inngest** — Event-based asynchronous orchestration of the merchant verification pipeline.
6. **Firecrawl** - Website analysis of merchant.
7. **Cloudinary** - Document storage in cloud

## Development Setup

Start the API:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start the Inngest development server in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:inngest
```

Both the API server and the Inngest development server need to be running to test the application in development mode.

## Notes

- A new Inngest event is triggered whenever a merchant verification is requested.

- The verification record is initially created with a `PENDING` status and is processed asynchronously by the Inngest workflow.

- Only one `PENDING` verification is allowed per merchant. A new request is rejected until the current verification is finished.

- Merchant updates are verified before being saved. If verification fails, the existing merchant data is unchanged.

- Pipeline stages can retry when temporary errors occur.

- You can monitor the verification workflows through the Inngest UI at: `http://localhost:8288`

- Swagger is used for API documentation and can be used to test the available endpoints with your own data.
